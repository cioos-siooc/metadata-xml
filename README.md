`metadata-xml` is a Python3 package for converting metadata records defined using
ACDD-style field names into XML that fits into the [CIOOS](https://www.cioos.ca)
metadata profile.

It can be used as a command line tool, or imported into other Python code.

## Installation

1. Setup and activate a new Python 3 environment
2. From this directory, run:

   `pip install .`

3. To upgrade this package if you have already installed it, use:

   `pip install . --upgrade`

   - or If you are developing this package, to avoid reinstalling each time,
     use:

     `pip install -e .`

## Command line usage

To convert a Yaml file to XML, run:

`python -m metadata_xml -f <yaml_file_path> -o <optional_destination_folder>`

eg:

`python -m metadata_xml -f sample_records/record.yml`

## Importing into other Python projects

You can perform the yaml to XML conversion in other projects this way:

```python
from metadata_xml.template_functions import metadata_to_xml

record = {...}
xml = metadata_to_xml(record)
```

and add to your requirements.txt:

`git+git://github.com/cioos-siooc/metadata-xml.git`

## YAML Metadata format

See `sample_records/record.yaml` for an example. Most text fields have the option to be bilingual, eg:

```yaml
   comment: just in the primary language

   # -- or --

   comment:
      en: comment in english
      fr: comment in french
```
